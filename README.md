# Artifacts MMO Runner

[Artifacts](https://www.artifactsmmo.com/) is a programatic MMORPG that is only playable through API calls.

This repo contains my attempt to work on his Golang skills / play Artifacts.

I went through the [tutorial](https://docs.artifactsmmo.com/quickstart/introduction) while watching the pods episodes of Love is Blind S8.

I have since added the four other characters and a lot of helper functions to do simple tasks.

## TO-DO
 
- [ ] Break out code over multiple files
- [ ] Store Locally Static Info like maps and crafting recipes
- [ ] Use An Event/Queue System to give tasks to my characters to complete versus always hard coding what they are doing at any given moment
- [ ] Use charm.sh to make a CLI for firing the events into the queue
